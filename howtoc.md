### Learn JEMMA

The best way to learn about JEMMA and its features is to follow the wiki-based tutorials, HOWTOs and manuals indexed in the [Documentation](howtos.html) section. More generic technical and research-oriented documentation (e.g. papers, white-papers, etc.) is available [here](resources.html).

The JEMMA source code can always be accessed from the official <a href="http://github.com/ismb/jemma" target="_parent">JEMMA GitHub page</a>[](). You can also download the latest snapshot of the full code repository in <a href="http://github.com/ismb/jemma/zipball/master" target="_parent">.zip</a> or <a href="http://github.com/ismb/jemma/tarball/master" target="_parent">.tar.gz</a> format.
