		<td>Smart Aqualtis is the first Indesit Company washing machine designed to be integrated in ‘Smart’ ecosystems, covering a wide range of use cases. The Cost Awereness function notifies the user of the estimated cost for the selected cycle based on a time based tariff while with the Energy Awareness functionality the washing machine calculates, visualizes and dispatches the energy and power consumption to the HAN during the selection and execution of the cycle. Thanks to the Coordinated Energy Management and to the Demand Response Management functions, the washing machine plays an active role in the energy ecosystem being capable of optimizing the power consumption in the home and of scheduling the starting time ensuring the cheapest or the greenest cycle, whilst always respecting the user’s constraints.</td>
