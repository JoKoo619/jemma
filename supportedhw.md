Here the meaning of icons on the "status" level.

- <img src="http://ismb.github.io/jemma/images/verified.png" alt="verified"> = Verified (with first JEMMA version where verification has been completed) 
- <img src="http://ismb.github.io/jemma/images/shouldwork.png" alt="should work"> = Should work (= compliant with supported ZigBee standard or already tested with some partial component of JEMMA, but not tested with the full solution) 
- <img src="http://ismb.github.io/jemma/images/incompatible.png" alt="incompatible"> = Incompatible (proven not to work - with link to the related issue on the [JEMMA Tracker](https://github.com/ismb/jemma/issues))
