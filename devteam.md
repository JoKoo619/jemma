### Direct inquiries
Contact the <a href="mailto:jemma-developers@googlegroups.com" target="_blank">JEMMA Development Team</a> for any inquiry related to business/technical/research aspects.

### Mailing list

The <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jemma-general" target="_blank">JEMMA General Mailing List</a> is the official place for public discussions among developers and users. This service is hosted by Google Groups.

#### Do you want to join **with a Google account** ?

To join with your Google account, just click "Apply to join group" in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jemma-general" target="_blank">JEMMA General Mailing List page</a>. After your membership is approved, you will be able to post new messages both by e-mail or using the web interface.

#### Do you want to join with **any other e-mail address** ?

You must fill-in your details (and some captcha) in this <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jemma-general/join" target="_blank">subscription form</a>. Google Groups will send a confirmation link in your inbox: you should click it to finalize the application request. You will then receive a notification when your membership is approved.
With this type of subscription you can post messages only by email, using <a href="mailto:jemma-general@googlegroups.com">jemma-general@googlegroups.com</a>. You will still be able to access the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jemma-general" target="_blank">public list archives</a>, but you will not be allowed to post via the web interface.

#### Troubles joining ?

Some users report troubles when joining with a non-Google e-mail address (e.g. a work mail). These problems probably happen when you are logged with a Google account (e.g. a personal account) during the join process. In order to avoid these issues, you can just **log out from any Google account before trying to join** with a non-Google e-mail address.
If still this does not work, please ask for assistance to the <a href="mailto:jemma-developers@googlegroups.com" target="_blank">JEMMA Development Team</a>.
