Version 1.0.0.qualifier:

** Bug	  
	* Added correct package version to exported packages it.telecomitalia.zgd and 
	  it.telecomitalia.zgd.jaxb in MANIFEST.MF. All the other packages MUST have
	  a version if they are exported as well
	  
	
** New Features
	* Added Feature A

** Changes
	* Added changelog.txt file
	* The project is both an OSGi bundle or a java jar file so a 
	  MANIFEST.MF and an Activator have been added
	* Renamed the javagal.properties file into config.ini
	* Created resources folder and moved there the config.ini
	* Using the getDataFile() method to access the config.ini file
	* In class FlexGridRxTx setting property gnu.io.rxtx.SerialPorts to the
	  port to open, to speed-up the RXTX port opening process.
	* Changed the Status class to be backward compatible. Some modifications
	  are still necessary.
	* In Starter class changed attribute configPath into configUrl (now of URL type)
	  to be compatible with OSGi getEntity return value.
	* Adapted PropertiesManager to use the configUrl. 
	
	
	
	Rinominato config.ini in config.properties
	Config.properties con impostazioni relative al gateway zigbee, eliminata gestione rest
