<!--<span style="color:red;">**This page is under construction**</span>: We expect to update this page along with the release of JEMMA [version 0.0.2](https://github.com/ismb/jemma/wiki/Milestone-0.0.2).-->


- **Green**: JEMMA core feature is the ability to support energy monitoring and management applications: after you deploy JEMMA in your home gateway it can discover all the available smart appliances (e.g. Smart Plugs, etc.) and make them available for internal or external applications.

- **Autonomous**: You just need to deploy it at home using any low-power gateway running Linux: JEMMA will seamlessly discover all your ZigBee-compliant devices, virtualize them as REST resources and use them to optimize your CO~2~ emissions and your energy bill. 

- **Smart**: JEMMA includes specific features for energy optimization, enhancement of energy awareness, deman-side management and other useful features to make your home more green and more inter-connected with the Smart Grid. 

- **Open**: JEMMA can be used freely also in commercial applications under the [LGPL license](license.html). 

- **Standards-friendly**: JEMMA implements the  [Energy@home specifications](http://www.energy-home.it/Documents/Technical%20Specifications/E@H_specification_ver0.95.pdf) and has been already tested for compliance with standard ZigBee devices including devices compliant with the [ZigBee Home Automation 1.2](http://www.zigbee.org/Standards/ZigBeeHomeAutomation/Overview.aspx) and the [ZigBee Gateway Device](http://www.zigbee.org/Standards/ZigbeeTelecomServices/Features.aspx) standards

- **Web-oriented**: All JEMMA features can be accessed remotely through its web-based RESTful APIs. JEMMA can also expose and virtualize as REST resources any smart appliance, energy storage or generation devices.

- **Modular**: JEMMA can be freely extended by deploying additional [OSGi](http://www.osgi.org/) bundles or by developing applications based on its open API.

- **Cloud-enabled**: JEMMA allows synchronizing your energy data with Cloud service offered by [Telecom Italia](http://www.telecomitalia.it/) (*support for other cloud service providers is foreseen in next releases*)
