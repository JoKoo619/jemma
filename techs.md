### Home Devices

JEMMA currently supports the [ZigBee Home Automation 1.2](http://www.zigbee.org/Standards/ZigBeeHomeAutomation/Overview.aspx) and the [ZigBee Gateway Device](http://www.zigbee.org/Standards/ZigbeeTelecomServices/Features.aspx) standards resulting from of a collaboration between the [Energy@home Association](http://www.energy-home.it/) and the [ZigBee Alliance](http://www.zigbee.org/).

### Software Architecture

The JEMMA software architecture is based on [OSGi](http://www.osgi.org/). 

3rd-party applications can be plugged into JEMMA either locally (via OSGi declarative services) or on the Cloud, through its web-based RESTful APIs.

### Toolchain

JEMMA uses a *pom-first* approach and leverages [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) to handle dependencies, automate builds, etc.
