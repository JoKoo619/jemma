JEMMA is a open-source (LGPL) framework which includes and supports energy monitoring and management application.
You just need to deploy it at home using any low-power gateway running Linux: JEMMA will seamlessly discover all your ZigBee-compliant devices (e.g. smart Plugs, Smart appliances, energy storages, energy sources, etc.), virtualize them as REST resources and use them to optimize your CO~2~ emissions and your energy bill.

With JEMMA you can develop advanced energy management applications either running locally or in the cloud.
