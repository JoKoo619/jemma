JEMMA is a open-source (LGPL) framework which implements the [Energy@home specifications](http://www.energy-home.it/Documents/Technical%20Specifications/E@H_specification_ver0.95.pdf) for energy monitoring and management application.

JEMMA currently supports the [ZigBee Home Automation 1.2](http://www.zigbee.org/Standards/ZigBeeHomeAutomation/Overview.aspx) and the [ZigBee Gateway Device](http://www.zigbee.org/Standards/ZigbeeTelecomServices/Features.aspx) standards resulting from of a collaboration between the [Energy@home Association](http://www.energy-home.it/) and the [ZigBee Alliance](http://www.zigbee.org/).

You just need to deploy it at home using any low-power gateway running Linux: JEMMA will seamlessly discover all your ZigBee-compliant devices (e.g. smart Plugs, Smart appliances, energy storages, energy sources, etc.), virtualize them as REST resources and use them to optimize your CO~2~ emissions and your energy bill.

With JEMMA you can develop advanced energy management applications either running locally or in the cloud.
